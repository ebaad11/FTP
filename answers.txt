Q1 

Each side has diffenrt ways of confirming and autentication

For the socket connection the user needs to send a user name and password to the server side to 
establish a connection. if that is successful the server links the ip addres of teh user to the channel.

no verification is needed on the client side--that is assuming the network has no firewalls, the client
reads the resposne message from the server and matches it to its internal state to see if the connection is made.

There is a better way to transfet files that is the passive and epassive commands these commands 
are when the client initiates teh connection wiht hte server the server sends a valid port numner other than defailt 21 

messge = 227 Entering Passive Mode (10,246,251,93,216,242).
the client then uses this port to make a connection to the server, this way the server doesnt have to go threou 
extra fire walls when sending data to the client.


Either way if some one listens to the streams of data listenting in they can easily see what is goin on 
as the data is not encrypted with the TLS


With each type of mode of transfer there are diffent security limitation 
with port the server is initaing the conneciton to the clinet and send

Q2
the client know this by porcessing the 3 digit code that is recieved through tht command resposne 

the codes are 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, these are the codes that allwo teh client to keeo track of the sender. the client uses andinternal 
dfa to keep track of thing

As the sender being trustworthu is hard to determin evern in passive mode as teh data is not encrypted.
so there is no guerentee of where the data is coming from.
